First, try drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. You can also try eating bland foods like rice or toast. If your stomach ache persists, you should see a doctor.\n",

      "* Liver transplant\n",

      "* Eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n",

      "* Get regular exercise. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n",
      "* Get enough sleep. Most adults need around 7-8 hours of sleep per night.\n",
